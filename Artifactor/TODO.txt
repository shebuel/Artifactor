Feature Request:

Phase 1:

3. Implement Image paste option 
4. Store the image locally so that it does not take much memory
5. Mark the check as done if an image is uploaded and let the user choose whether a check is done or not
6. Convert the check to excel 

Phase 2:

1. Change layout so that all the pages can fit in one window
2. Save progress so that the user does not start over when they accidentally close the application
	- When the user presses the close button the application stores data as json
	- When the user chooses that folder again it reads the json file and show previous progress
	- Create a save button to manually save progress every few minutes


Phase 3:

1. Implement the application as MVVM model?
2. Use a standard layout
3.


Issues:

- The app hangs for a few seconds when the output folder is selected from the URL in folderpicker.
- App crashes if image not in clipboard while clicking the paste button
